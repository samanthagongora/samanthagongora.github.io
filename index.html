    <h2>Module 1: Been there, done that!</h2>
    <p>Many of you know that I started my journey at Turing almost 7 weeks ago. 
      As of last Thursday, June 8, 2017, I have finally completed my first module.
      Having beginner experience in Ruby, I set out to learn as much as possible
      about test driven development, business tools (git, github, slack, etc.),
      pair-programming, and debugging. Starting out in mod 1, testing was painful.
      I have noticed a significant reduction in pain while testing in my current
      work. I would venture to say it's becoming enjoyable. I strongly believe
      the skills I have learned related to pair-programming and debugging will
      be invaluable during my career at Turing and elsewhere. Looking back on
      where I was 6 weeks ago, I am proud of how much I have learned and the
      effort I have put into the program.</p>
